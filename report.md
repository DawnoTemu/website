## 1. Executive Summary

Quantum computing, an emerging technology leveraging quantum mechanics, presents a dual-edged sword for U.S. law enforcement. While its mature form threatens to break current encryption standards, jeopardizing sensitive data and national security, it also promises unprecedented computational power to solve complex problems, from decrypting criminal communications to optimizing investigations. U.S. agencies, particularly the FBI, must urgently prepare by investing in post-quantum cryptography (PQC), fostering a quantum-aware workforce, and exploring pilot use cases. Proactive adoption of quantum-resistant security, collaboration with research partners, and careful policy development are crucial to harness quantum benefits for forensics, cybersecurity, and intelligence, while mitigating risks to privacy and civil liberties. Strategic action today will position law enforcement to leverage this transformative technology and counter its challenges effectively.

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Background of Quantum Computing

The theoretical underpinnings of quantum computing emerged in the late 20th century, with Richard Feynman’s 1980s proposal for quantum-based simulators. Peter Shor's 1994 algorithm, capable of factoring large integers exponentially faster than classical methods, highlighted quantum computing's potential to break RSA encryption, a cornerstone of digital security, galvanizing government interest. Early experimental quantum processors (5-7 qubits) were demonstrated around 1998-2001. The first commercial quantum annealer (128 qubits) was released in 2011. A major milestone was Google's 2019 "quantum supremacy" claim. Since then, hardware has rapidly advanced, with IBM showcasing 433-qubit processors by 2022, marking the "second quantum revolution."

### 2.2 Law-Enforcement Relevance

U.S. law enforcement, including the FBI, views quantum computing with both apprehension and anticipation. The primary threat is its potential to render current encryption obsolete, exposing sensitive government data, investigative files, and secure communications. Adversaries might already be harvesting encrypted data for future decryption ("harvest now, decrypt later"). The FBI has warned of foreign actors targeting U.S. quantum research. Conversely, quantum computing offers powerful tools: decrypting illicit communications, analyzing vast datasets for criminal patterns, and optimizing investigative workflows. Europol notes its potential for cold case investigations and digital forensics. The FBI aims to both defend against quantum threats and harness its power for mission advancement.

### 2.3 Scope & Objectives

This chapter provides an overview of quantum computing's relevance to U.S. law enforcement, focusing on the FBI. It covers fundamental quantum concepts, the current technological state (as of 2025), potential use cases (investigations, forensics, operational support, cybersecurity), implementation considerations (integration, resources, ethics), and limitations. A forward-looking roadmap outlines near-, mid-, and long-term developments. The objective is to equip law enforcement leaders with a clear understanding of quantum computing's evolution, applications, and preparatory steps, without delving deeply into quantum physics or endorsing specific vendors, and distinct from quantum sensing or communication except for context.

## 3. Technology Fundamentals

## 6. Implementation Considerations

### 6.1 Technical Integration

Integrating quantum computing requires interfacing with legacy IT systems. This involves developing APIs for quantum backends, ensuring secure network connectivity (PQC-VPNs, dedicated lines) to cloud or partner QC resources, and managing data formats. Classical pre- and post-processing of quantum results will be essential. Decisions on cloud vs. potential on-premise (or government-hosted secure enclave) access will impact integration. User interfaces must abstract quantum complexity for analysts.

### 6.2 Resource Requirements

Significant resources are needed:

- **Human Capital:** Hiring or training specialized personnel (quantum analysts, cryptanalysts) is crucial and competitive.
- **Financial:** Cloud QC access is costly; dedicated hardware is multi-million dollar. Budgets for pilots, operational use, and PQC migration are required.
- **Infrastructure:** If hosting, specialized labs are needed. Even with cloud, robust classical compute and secure network upgrades are necessary.
- **Time:** R&D and integration take time and patience; immediate returns are unlikely.

### 6.3 Data Governance, Privacy, and Civil Liberties

Quantum capabilities, especially decryption, demand strict governance. "Store now, decrypt later" tactics raise Fourth Amendment concerns. Policies must limit indiscriminate retention/decryption, requiring specific legal authorization (e.g., warrants). Oversight mechanisms and transparency (e.g., reporting on quantum surveillance) are needed to maintain public trust. Data fed to quantum analyses must be lawfully acquired and checked for bias to avoid discriminatory outcomes. International data sharing will require updated agreements.

### 6.4 Ethical, Legal, and Societal Implications

The power asymmetry of quantum-enabled surveillance requires strong ethical guidelines to prevent misuse (e.g., targeting dissidents). Legal precedents for quantum-derived evidence (admissibility, cross-examination) need development. Public perception management is vital to avoid fear of an "Orwellian" state. Agencies must ensure quantum tools are not used to perpetuate bias. U.S. leadership in ethical quantum use can influence global norms.

### 6.5 Risk Management & Security Hardening

Quantum systems and access pathways are high-value targets. Hardening involves strong cybersecurity for QC interfaces and PQC for data in transit. Result integrity needs verification due to NISQ errors. Vendor/supply-chain risks for QC services must be vetted. Operational continuity plans are needed for QC downtime. Agencies must also manage risks from adversaries using quantum capabilities, primarily by accelerating PQC adoption.

## 7. Current Limitations & Challenges

### 7.1 Technology-Intrinsic Constraints

- **Decoherence and Error Rates:** Qubits are fragile, leading to high error rates in NISQ-era devices, limiting computation depth and reliability.
- **Limited Qubit Counts and Connectivity:** Current systems (hundreds of qubits) are insufficient for breaking strong, modern encryption (needs thousands of error-corrected qubits). Connectivity between qubits is also limited.
- **Quantum Algorithm Availability:** Proven, advantageous quantum algorithms exist for only a few problem classes. Many law enforcement tasks lack tailored quantum solutions.
- **Speed and Resource Intensity:** NISQ devices can be slower than classical counterparts for many practical problems due to overhead and noise.
- **Complexity of Use:** Programming and interpreting quantum results requires specialized expertise.

### 7.2 Operational & Organizational Barriers

Law enforcement culture may resist new, unproven technologies. Lack of in-house quantum expertise, competing budget priorities, difficulties integrating quantum into existing workflows, and interdepartmental silos hinder adoption. Public skepticism can also be a barrier.

### 7.3 Legal/Policy Gaps

Existing laws (e.g., ECPA) don't specifically address quantum decryption or surveillance. Admissibility standards for quantum-derived evidence are undefined. International law lacks protocols for cross-border quantum data access or assistance. Data retention policies for "harvest now, decrypt later" data are unclear.

### 7.4 Potential Adverse Impacts & Public Perception

Public fear of "ultimate surveillance" could erode trust. Criminals will adapt with PQC or low-tech methods. Over-reliance on quantum tools might degrade traditional investigative skills. Misinformation about quantum capabilities can fuel conspiracy theories. Inequitable use could exacerbate societal biases.
